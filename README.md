### Disclaimers
- Evil spirits are not real. Even if they were, BEGONE is not designed to banish them. BEGONE should only be used as an excuse to run around the woods with your friends and make up a spooky story together.
- Respect the environment and any bystanders you meet while playing BEGONE. Never incorporate fire into your ritual, no matter how cool you think it would be.

# BEGONE
A method to identify a nature-corrupting spirit and persuade it to leave.

### Materials
- 3 or more Mystics
- Notepads and pencils
- (optional) Gloves
- (optional) Carrying bags

### Method Overview
1. Designate a location within the corrupted area as your campsite.
1. Split into groups or individuals. Randomly divide all Singular Tasks among yourselves.
1. From the campsite, journey in separate directions. Complete all 5 General Tasks and any assigned Singular Tasks.
   - *Beware: The spirit's gaze is upon you. Take all necessary precautions, especially if traveling alone.*
1. After an agreed-upon time period, reunite at the campsite.
1. Combine your research to gain an understanding of the corrupting spirit.
1. When ready, conduct the Purification Ritual.

### General Tasks
- Discern the spirit's effects on the area. Note any time you feel its presence.
- Whenever something unusual occurs, decide whether it's a Good Omen or an Ill Omen.
- Write down any known lore that might pertain to this case.
- Collect an Object of Power. This can be anything in the environment that calls to you.
- After all other Tasks are complete, deduce one or more Offerings the spirit might appreciate based on what you know.
    - An Offering can be a found object, something you have brought with you, something you create, or even a physical act or performance.

### Singular Tasks
- Discover the name of the corrupting spirit based on an unusual sound you hear.
- Design 4 Glyphs that represent the environment â€“ two of them representing its Pure aspects and two of them representing its Foul aspects.
    - You may label them if needed.
- Decide on the most effective location from which to conduct the Purification Ritual.
- Gather materials with which to encircle the ritual space. Decide how they will be arranged.
- In your mind's eye, behold a Symbol representing the spirit and draw it.

### Discussion
- One at a time, relay your experiences and present your creations. Produce your Objects of Power and describe them.
- Based on the group's findings, discern the spirit's powers and motivations.
    - Note that initial assumptions may have been incorrect and may be revised based on group consensus.
- (optional) Sketch what the spirit might look like.

### Final Preparations
- Tally the total numbers of Good Omens and Ill Omens.
- Draw each of the 4 Glyphs on separate slips of paper.
- Draw the Symbol of the spirit on a new page, modifying the original design if necessary.
- When the time is right, gather at the designated ritual site.

### Creating the Ritual Space
- Encircle the ritual space. All Mystics must stay within these bounds until the ritual is complete.
- Place the Objects of Power at significant points within the space. These must not be disturbed.
    - (optional) Mark each Object of Power with a Pure Glyph.
- Place the Symbol of the spirit in a prominent location.
- Stand in silent meditation for at least ten seconds to consecrate the space.
    - *Beware: The spirit is now present. Do not touch its Symbol from this point forward.*

### Communicating With the Spirit
- Within the ritual space, a Mystic may communicate with the spirit by addressing its Symbol with a yes-or-no question.
- To receive the answer, select two Glyphs at random. Two Pure Glyphs represent an affirmation, while two Foul Glyphs represent a denial. A mixed result is a refusal to answer.

### Conducting the Ritual
- Before beginning, the Mystics may ask the spirit questions to resolve any remaining uncertainties or disagreements.
- To complete the ritual, the spirit must agree to leave 3 times. If more Ill Omens were encountered than Good Omens, it must agree 4 times.
- If, at any time, a previously recognized Ill Omen presents itself, increase the number of agreements needed by 1. Likewise, if a previously recognized Good Omen is beheld, decrease the number by 1.
- Present an Offering, then ask aloud whether the spirit agrees to leave.
    - If it answers in the affirmative, reduce the number of agreements needed by 1.
    - If it refuses to answer, modify the Offering in some significant way and try again.
    - If it answers in the negative, this Offering may not be used again.
- If all needed agreements have been attained, the ritual is complete. Stand once more in silent meditation, then exit the space.
- If all Offerings have been rejected, leave the space at once. *Do not linger.*
    - At this point, the Mystics may reconvene at the campsite to discuss what went wrong, devise a new set of Offerings, and try again.

### Player Tips
- You may be tempted to lie about your separate journeys to make them creepier or more exciting. Do so.
- Maintain a "Yes, and..." approach to the storytelling process. If two players' ideas conflict, err on the side of consistency with what has already been established.
- Use props to heighten the atmosphere. Wear a witchy outfit, conduct divination with a dowsing pendulum, carry a wizard's staff, etc.
